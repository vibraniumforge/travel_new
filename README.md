Welcome to my Travel Places app! It allows users to record locations that they have travelled to and notes about the locations as well.

The user can choose a new username. The user also adds an email address. Lastly, the user chooses a password at least 4 characters long.

The user can record a location with by its Continent, Country, State or Province, and City. There is an optional Notes parameter as well. Users cannot see or edit other user's locations. Users can Create a new location, edit an existing location, read one or all locations, and delete a location.

It uses Ruby and Sinatra to generate web pages. It uses shotgun to run a local server.

Two sample users: 
Rick_Steves password=1234
Rudy_Maxa password=1234
